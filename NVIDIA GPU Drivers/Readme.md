There is a feature missing from this code.  If a host has an unsupported GPU as its main GPU but a supported GPU as its secondary, the supported GPUs will not get drivers installed.  For example, if a host has an NVS 310 and 2 Quadros, the Quadros will not get their drivers.  This can be fixed by itterating through all the GPUs listed by WMI and executing code accordingly.  Since the drivers are installed as a clean install though, we would also need to track which GPU has had drivers installed so that if there are multiple of the same GPU we are not reinstalling the same driver 4 times.
