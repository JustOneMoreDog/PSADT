Getting Matlab working will require a little trial and error.  If you are having issues contact their support as that is how I figured out my error.  In this folder I had `source.zip` which contained all the files needed for the installation.  You can grab the offline installer from [their website](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/).  I used [this guide](http://www.get-itsolutions.com/matlab-silent-install-msi-offline-installer/) to help get me started on this.
