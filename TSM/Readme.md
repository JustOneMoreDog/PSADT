This was designed to be used in a ConfigMgr Task Sequence.  When doing a zero touch installation, Powershell scripts are run in the background and you do not see anything.  Any output is put into the `smsts.log` file.  Since TSM requires the input of a password though, it needs to interactive.  The file `ApplicationStarterStarter.ps1` will run in the background but the new Powershell process that it starts will be visiable.  `ApplicationStarter.ps1` is the GUI that you can interact with.  If you enter the wrong password it will let you know and you can try again.  If you do not have the password and wish to just install TSM later, you can do so too as this can be run through the Software Center just fine.
